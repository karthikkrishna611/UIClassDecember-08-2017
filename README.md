To know if some one has made changes to existing code

	`git status`

To get the latest changes done by other in the code into your computer cmd:
	`git pull`

To know which file I might have modified or current status of code use cmd :

To prepare which resources must be sent into the remote repo (server)
	`git add filename1 filename2` to send only selected resources(files)
		or
